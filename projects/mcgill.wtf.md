**mcgill.wtf** is a fast full-text search of McGill's entire course catalog with
a server implemented in Rust and an intuitive front-end built using React.

I was inspired to build this after seeing [classes.wtf](https://classes.wtf/), a
super fast course search engine for Harvard's course catalog implemented by
[Eric Zhang](https://www.ekzhang.com/) - in addition to noticing a need for this
considering McGill's lack of full-text course search infrastructure.
