This project is a simple wrapper around the
[ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) API to allow for fast queries within
the [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) text editor.

I wrote this soon after an
[unofficial API wrapper](https://github.com/acheong08/ChatGPT) came out for
ChatGPT mostly as a way to explore writing Neovim plugins in Python.
