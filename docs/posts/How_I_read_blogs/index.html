            How I read blogs
          </h1>
          <div class="post-text">
            <p>I have recently gotten into the habit of reading more blogs, in particular, ones featured on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/news">HackerNews</a>.</p>
<p>Reading books, personally, has been a difficult habit to cultivate over time, which I mainly attribute to the periodic feelings of being “stuck” or bored on a certain set of books. Blogs, however, offer a condensed read making them efficient and often amusing sources of information.</p>
<p>My typical sourcing routine would usually just consist of scrolling through HackerNews, potentially seeing something that peaked my interest and reading it, or realizing I didn’t have the time and putting the url off in a <code>.txt</code> file somewhere.</p>
<p>Realizing the severe lack of efficiency present in this routine, I thought about how to make it better. First, by asking the question: what were the things I didn’t like?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Having to scroll through articles myself</li>
<li>Reading on mobile or desktop</li>
<li>Having no effortless <code>like</code> or <code>archive</code> feature</li>
</ol>
<p>To address these problems I chose to try out <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/"><code>Instapaper</code></a> and build a simple tool called <a href="https://github.com/terror/hackerpaper"><code>hackerpaper</code></a>.</p>
<p>Instapaper has a feature that let’s you send articles to your Kindle, which makes reading blogs much more comfortable. Moreover, the built in <code>like</code> and <code>archive</code> features carryover to the Kindle as well, making it a seamless process of <code>read</code> -&gt; <code>archive or like</code> -&gt; <code>repeat</code>.</p>
<p>To solve the issue of having to scroll through articles myself and add them to Instapaper, I built <code>hackerpaper</code>. This tool sends HackerNews articles to Instapaper with certain filters such as type, subdomains or a specific article id.</p>
<p>I run a <code>cron job</code> that sends the articles to Instapaper at 5:00AM and have Instapaper send those articles to my Kindle at 7:00AM.</p>
<p>The script is as simple as this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="ex">~/path/to/python3</span> ~/path/to/hackerpaper -a <span class="op">&lt;</span>email<span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="op">&lt;</span>password<span class="op">&gt;</span> -t topstories</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To recap the routine: - Have <code>hackerpaper</code> send articles to Instapaper - Have <code>Instapaper</code> send those articles to Kindle - Read and archive those articles - Repeat</p>
